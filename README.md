### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

This is Gulam Sarwer Naeem and I'm from Sylhet, Bangladesh. I'm a software developer and currently working on MEVN stack. I am a quick learner and flexible to changes in the plans of senior and mentors. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks. I like programming and my life goal is to help people with code.
